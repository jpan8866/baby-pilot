## Lab 1, Part B
### Advanced Mapping and Routing with A* (Steps 6 and 8)
Advanced mapping is implemented in the file advanced_mapping.py, and 
A* search algorithm in path_finder.py In order to test the functions,
run routing_test.py. This generates a grid with obstacles detected along
with the best path across the obstacles.

### Object Detection (Step 7)
Run the file detect.py to get real time object detection. The inferences
print out onto the console.

### Vehicle Driving
In order for the car to follow to an acceptable level of precision the path
generated by A*, we implement some functions for control in vehicle_control.py.
